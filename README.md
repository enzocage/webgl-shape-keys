This repo holds 3D Facial Animation demo using WebGL. The 3D face itself comes from a blender file created by Taha Algherbawy found at blendswap.com. The 3D data for the face was extracted from blender through a python script found in the root directory of this repo.

This demo has an accompanying blog post that explains it further:
